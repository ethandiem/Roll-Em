Roll-Em

The goal of this project is to create a game that I used to play called Roll-Em.

In this game there is two dice and a block of wood with holes to put pins shaped similar to golf tees. There are numbers 1-10 corrosponding with those holes. In this game whatever number is rolled the player can remove the pins adding up to the number the player rolls. The goal is to remove the most amount of pins you can before you cannot remove any anymore.

For example, if the player rolls a 5, the player can remove a variety of combonations of pins. 2 and 3, 4 and 1, or just 5. If a player rolls an 8 they can remove 5 and 3, 6 and 2, 7 and 1, or just 8.

The player loses when no more pins can be pulled after a dice roll.

For example, if the player has pins left in 3 and 5, and the player rolls a 9. No combonation of the remaining pins can equal that dice roll. Therefore the player would run out of moves and they would lose.

If the player manages to remove every single pin on the board they win.
